  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "admin123"}'
```

  -d '{
    "name": "My Workout",
    "description": "Workout description",
    "difficulty": "beginner",
    "type": "full_body",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "created_by_admin": true
  }'
```

### 3. Create Exercise with Files

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/exercises \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "workout_id=$WORKOUT_ID" \
  -F "name=Exercise Name" \
  -F "instructions=Exercise instructions" \
  -F "video=@path/to/video.mp4" \
  -F "image=@path/to/image.jpg" \
